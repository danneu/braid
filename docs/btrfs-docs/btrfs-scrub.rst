btrfs-scrub(8)
==============

SYNOPSIS
--------

**btrfs scrub** <subcommand> <args>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scrub is a validation pass over all filesystem data and metadata that detects
data checksum errors, basic super block errors, basic metadata block header errors,
and disk read errors.

Scrub is done on a per-device base, if a device is specified to :command:`btrfs scrub start`,
then only that device will be scrubbed. Although btrfs will also try to read
other device to find a good copy, if the mirror on that specified device failed
to be read or pass verification.

If a path of btrfs is specified to :command:`btrfs scrub start`, btrfs will scrub
all devices in parallel.

On filesystems that use replicated block group profiles (e.g. RAID1), read-write
scrub will also automatically repair any damage by copying verified good data
from one of the other replicas.

Such automatic repair is also carried out when reading metadata or data from a
read-write mounted filesystem.

.. warning::
   As currently implemented, setting the ``NOCOW`` file attribute (by
   :command:`chattr +C`) on a file implicitly enables
   ``NODATASUM``. This means that while metadata for these files continues to
   be validated and corrected by scrub, the actual file data is not.

   Furthermore, btrfs does not currently mark missing or failed disks as
   unreliable, so will continue to load-balance reads to potentially damaged
   replicas. This is not a problem normally because damage is detected by
   checksum validation, but because ``NOCOW`` files are
   not protected by checksums, btrfs has no idea which mirror is good thus it can
   return the bad contents to the user space tool.

   Detecting and recovering from such failure requires manual intervention.

   Notably, `systemd sets +C on journals by default <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/11689d2a021d95a8447d938180e0962cd9439763>`__,
   and `libvirt ≥ 6.6 sets +C on storage pool directories by default <https://www.libvirt.org/news.html#v6-6-0-2020-08-02>`__.
   Other applications or distributions may also set ``+C`` to try to improve
   performance.

.. note::
   Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck, :doc:`btrfs-check`). It can only detect
   filesystem damage using the checksum validation, and it can only repair
   filesystem damage by copying from other known good replicas.

   :doc:`btrfs-check` performs more exhaustive checking and can sometimes be
   used, with expert guidance, to rebuild certain corrupted filesystem structures
   in the absence of any good replica.

.. note::
   Read-only scrub on a read-write filesystem will cause some writes into the
   filesystem.

   This is due to the design limitation to prevent race between marking block
   group read-only and writing back block group items.

   To avoid any writes from scrub, one has to run read-only scrub on read-only
   filesystem.

.. note::
   Scrub can be interrupted by various events after v6.19 kernel, including
   but not limited to power management suspend/hibernate, filesystem freezing,
   cgroup freezing (utilized by systemd for slice freezing) and pending signals.

   The running scrub will be cancelled after such interruption, and can be resumed
   by :command:`btrfs scrub resume` command.

The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service. The
recommended period is a month but it could be less. The estimated device bandwidth
utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem.

The scrubbing status is recorded in :file:`/var/lib/btrfs/` in textual files named
*scrub.status.UUID* for a filesystem identified by the given UUID. (Progress
state is communicated through a named pipe in file *scrub.progress.UUID* in the
same directory.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub
will continue from the last saved position.

Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it's possible to
scrub only a selected device. See :ref:`btrfs scrub start<man-scrub-start>` for more.

Bandwidth and IO limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   The :manref:`ionice(1)` may not be generally supported by all IO schedulers and
   the options to :command:`btrfs scrub start` may not work as expected.

In the past when the `CFQ IO scheduler
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_fair_queueing>`__ was generally used
the :manref:`ionice(1)` syscalls set the priority to *idle* so the IO would not
interfere with regular IO. Since the kernel 5.0 the CFQ is not available.

The IO scheduler known to support that is `BFQ
<https://docs.kernel.org/block/bfq-iosched.html>`__, but first read the
documentation before using it!

For other commonly used schedulers like `mq-deadline
<https://docs.kernel.org/block/blk-mq.html>`__ it's recommended to use
*cgroup2 IO controller* which could be managed by e.g. *systemd*
(documented in ``systemd.resource-control``). However, starting scrub like that
is not yet completely straightforward. The IO controller must know the physical
device of the filesystem and create a slice so all processes started from that
belong to the same accounting group.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ systemd-run -p "IOReadBandwidthMax=/dev/sdx 10M" btrfs scrub start -B /

Since linux 5.14 it's possible to set the per-device bandwidth limits in a
BTRFS-specific way using files :file:`/sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo/DEVID/scrub_speed_max`.
This setting is not persistent, lasts until the filesystem is unmounted.
Currently set limits can be displayed by command :ref:`btrfs scrub
limit<man-scrub-limit>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ echo 100m > /sys/fs/btrfs/9b5fd16e-1b64-4f9b-904a-74e74c0bbadc/devinfo/1/scrub_speed_max
   $ btrfs scrub limit /

SUBCOMMAND
----------

cancel <path>|<device>
        If a scrub is running on the filesystem identified by *path* or
        *device*, cancel it.

        If a *device* is specified, the corresponding filesystem is found and
        :command:`btrfs scrub cancel` behaves as if it was called on that filesystem.
        The progress is saved in the status file so :command:`btrfs scrub resume` can
        continue from the last position.

.. _man-scrub-limit:

limit [options] <path>
	Show or set scrub limits on devices of the given filesystem.

        ``Options``

        -d|--devid DEVID
                select the device by DEVID to apply the limit
        -l|--limit SIZE
                set the limit of the device to SIZE (size units with suffix),
                or 0 to reset to *unlimited*
	-a|--all
                apply the limit to all devices

        --raw
                print all numbers raw values in bytes without the *B* suffix
        --human-readable
                print human friendly numbers, base 1024, this is the default
        --iec
                select the 1024 base for the following options, according to
                the IEC standard
        --si
                select the 1000 base for the following options, according to the SI standard
        --kbytes
                show sizes in KiB, or kB with --si
        --mbytes
                show sizes in MiB, or MB with --si
        --gbytes
                show sizes in GiB, or GB with --si
        --tbytes
                show sizes in TiB, or TB with --si

resume [-BdqrR] <path>|<device>
        Resume a cancelled or interrupted scrub on the filesystem identified by
        *path* or on a given *device*. The starting point is read from the
        status file if it exists.

        This does not start a new scrub if the last scrub finished successfully.

        ``Options``

        see :command:`scrub start`.

.. _man-scrub-start:

start [options] <path>|<device>
        Start a scrub on all devices of the mounted filesystem identified by
        *path* or on a single *device*. If a scrub is already running, the new
        one will not start. A device of an unmounted filesystem cannot be
        scrubbed this way.

        Without options, scrub is started as a background process. The
        automatic repairs of damaged copies are performed by default for block
        group profiles with redundancy. No-repair can be enabled by option *-r*.

        ``Options``

        -B
                do not background and print scrub statistics when finished
        -d
                print separate statistics for each device of the filesystem
                (*-B* only) at the end
        -r
                run in read-only mode, do not attempt to correct anything, can
                be run on a read-only filesystem

                Note that a read-only scrub on a read-write filesystem can
                still cause writes into the filesystem due to some internal
                limitations.  Only a read-only scrub on a read-only filesystem
                can avoid writes from scrub.
        -R
                raw print mode, print full data instead of summary
	--limit <limit>
		set the scrub throughput limit for each device.

		If the scrub is for the whole filesystem, it's the same as
		:command:`btrfs scrub limit --all --limit <value>`.
		If the scrub is for a single device, it's the same as
		:command:`btrfs scrub limit --devid <devid> -l <value>`.

		The value is bytes per second, and accepts the usual KMGT suffixes.
		After the scrub is finished, the throughput limit will be reset to
		the old value of each device.
        -f
                force starting new scrub even if a scrub is already running,
                this can useful when scrub status file is damaged and reports a
                running scrub although it is not, but should not normally be
                necessary

        ``Deprecated options``

        The priority settings work only with certain schedulers, in particular
        they *don't* work with the most common one *mq-deadline*.

        -c <ioprio_class>
                set IO priority class (see :manref:`ionice(1)` manual page) if the IO
                scheduler configured for the device supports ionice. This is
                only supported by BFQ or Kyber but is *not* supported by
                mq-deadline. Please read the section about
                :docref:`IO limiting <btrfs-scrub:scrub-io-limiting>`.
        -n <ioprio_classdata>
                set IO priority classdata (see :manref:`ionice(1)` manpage)
        -q
                (deprecated) alias for global *-q* option

status [options] <path>|<device>
        Show status of a running scrub for the filesystem identified by *path*
        or for the specified *device*.

        If no scrub is running, show statistics of the last finished or
        cancelled scrub for that filesystem or device. The status is read from
        the file located in :file:`/var/lib/btrfs`.

        ``Options``

        -d
                print separate statistics for each device of the filesystem
        -R
                print all raw statistics without postprocessing as returned by
                the status ioctl
        --raw
                print all numbers raw values in bytes without the *B* suffix
        --human-readable
                print human friendly numbers, base 1024, this is the default
        --iec
                select the 1024 base for the following options, according to
                the IEC standard
        --si
                select the 1000 base for the following options, according to the SI standard
        --kbytes
                show sizes in KiB, or kB with --si
        --mbytes
                show sizes in MiB, or MB with --si
        --gbytes
                show sizes in GiB, or GB with --si
        --tbytes
                show sizes in TiB, or TB with --si

        A status on a filesystem without any error looks like the following:

        .. code-block:: none

           # btrfs scrub start /
           # btrfs scrub status /
           UUID:             76fac721-2294-4f89-a1af-620cde7a1980
           Scrub started:    Wed Apr 10 12:34:56 2023

           Rate:             2.75GiB/s
           Error summary:    no errors found

        With some errors found:

        .. code-block:: none

           Error summary:    csum=72
             Corrected:      2
             Uncorrectable:  72
             Unverified:     0

        *  *Corrected* -- number of bad blocks that were repaired from another copy
        *  *Uncorrectable* -- errors detected at read time but not possible to repair from other copy
        *  *Unverified* -- transient errors, first read failed but a retry
           succeeded, may be affected by lower layers that group or split IO requests
        *  *Error summary* -- followed by a more detailed list of errors found

           *  *csum* -- checksum mismatch
           *  *super* -- super block errors, unless the error is fixed
              immediately, the next commit will overwrite superblock
           *  *verify* -- metadata block header errors
           *  *read* -- blocks can't be read due to IO errors

        It's possible to set a per-device limit via file
        :file:`sysfs/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo/scrub_speed_max`. In that case
        the limit is printed on the *Rate:* line if option *-d* is specified,
        or without it on a single-device filesystem.  Read more about tat in
        section about :docref:`scrub IO limiting <btrfs-scrub:scrub-io-limiting>`.

        .. code-block:: none

           Rate:             989.0MiB/s (limit 1.0G/s)

        On a multi-device filesystem with at least one device limit the
        overall stats cannot print the limit without *-d* so there's a not that
        some limits are set:

        .. code-block:: none

           Rate:             36.37MiB/s (some device limits set)
